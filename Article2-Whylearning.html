                        <p>Passion is not always enough. Because it may compel us to tread everything in front of us,
                            and ignore the feelings of others, even those closest to us, and therefore there must be a
                            pause in our life and work, as well as reflecting on the lives and successes of others, and
                            following the method of thinking and decision, and always thinking about the word (price)
                            that carries many meanings The price here is not the money in our pockets, or what we have,
                            but the price may be what we pay from our lives, the price may be our life, a life we
                            ​​spend in a society that draws people into several rows, and we have to walk in those rows
                            and paths in a specific time rhythm, so if you take your time to achieve Your dream or your
                            goal, you deviate from the path drawn for you by your society, and you may be criticized by
                            everyone, but you do not have to as long as there is an achievement that is counted for
                            you.<br><br>any of us do not know why learn and may not be interested in it, and most of us
                            suffered from this question in their early university life without setting any
                            goals.<br><br>Individuals may learn for the love of learning, filling the void, adventure
                            and discovery, or they learn in order to broaden the base of awareness In all cases,
                            learning raises a person’s awareness and expands his perceptions, and contributes to the
                            transformation of his life into more seriousness and coding for what is to come.<br><br>. So
                            why do we learn? ... there are many reasons that invite us and motivate us to learn, the
                            most important of which are: We learn in order to be polite, for the science that does not
                            change the chemistry of the soul and makes you a higher human being is not a useful science,
                            medicine that does not throw mercy into your heart is not science, and education that strips
                            humanity during the educational learning process is not science, and literature here has
                            several levels, the first and the names of which are Literature with God (Know, therefore,
                            that there is no god but Allah, and ask forgiveness for thy fault, and for the men and women
                            who believe: for Allah knows how ye move about and how ye dwell in your homes.) "Muhamamd 19
                            "<br><br>Learn to obtain the conditions of strength ([ Allah ] said, "O John, take the
                            Scripture with determination. " And We gave him judgement [while yet] a boy) “Maryam
                            12”<br><br>Knowledge is important and honest, and therefore the subject of science and
                            learning must be taken seriously and with interest, so that we do not pay a heavy price for
                            our lives for our negligence, as everyone must bear responsibility for the decision that he
                            takes and accomplishes with strength and superiority, and the idea of ​​acquiring knowledge
                            is the basis for the acquisition of power, and power here does not mean oppression and
                            domination As we see in many countries and societies the production of weapons of
                            destruction and stirring discord and rivalry between peoples, but also fighting between
                            members of the same community, which leads to stopping the wheel of development and progress
                            for those nations, and therefore education here becomes a tool for oppression and is equal
                            to ignorance, and it may even be worse But strength here means mastery of work and
                            dedication to it.<br><br>We learn in order to attain wisdom: (He gives wisdom to whom He
                            wills, and whoever has been given wisdom has certainly been given much good. And none will
                            remember except those of understanding.) “Al-Baqarah 269” Wisdom is the highest level of
                            educational attainment. What is between acceptable and unacceptable, coupled with fair
                            judgment and insight, wisdom includes the ability to learn, utter wise sayings and act with
                            wisdom and exhortation, as well as the distinction of being a mixture between knowledge,
                            experience and a deep understanding of tolerance and balance.<br><br>We learn in order to
                            seek reform (I only intend reform to the best of my ability. My success comes only through
                            Allah. In Him I trust and to Him I turn.)<br><br>Therefore, we must always seek science for
                            the sake of goodness and reform whenever we can, otherwise there is no benefit from science
                            with which we seek to destroy or destroy those around us, or even destroy humanity, as is
                            happening now in many countries and what results from scientific research and other
                            practices that affect Negatively affect human life.<br><br>We learn to complete the ethical
                            system associated with science, the system of three circles: the circle of self-knowledge,
                            the circle of knowledge of the universe, and the circle of knowledge of the Creator. The
                            elevation of science and scholars.<br><br>Learning improves understanding of the meaning of
                            life and dealing with its various challenges. The more you learn, you are like someone
                            hoarding gold coins every time. Learning develops and enhances openness and prosperity at
                            the intellectual level. So the question was why learn? It is an important question in life's
                            journey, because the ultimate goal is to please God and raise the value of the
                            nation.<br><br>We learn to be a high-end society, and a high society in our opinion is one
                            whose members believe in progress and development and are linked by the bond of affection,
                            compassion, love, respect and ideals, and its children distancing themselves from
                            selfishness and self-love, affirming the spirit of cooperation and solidarity, and achieving
                            justice that we lack in this time, and in order to achieve the high society We must all
                            enjoy the noble morals, principles and values ​​that motivate us to master work and
                            dedication, as we mentioned previously, the Almighty said Cooperate with one another in
                            goodness and righteousness, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression.).<br><br>We learn
                            to have a strong economy, and by a strong economy we mean community self-sufficiency in all
                            aspects, and this comes with good planning and constructive cooperation between all the
                            nation's institutions to ensure that the demands and needs of citizens are properly met,
                            while finding a balance in the distribution process, or what is called (distribution
                            justice) It would push individuals to exert more efforts in order to develop their country
                            and bring it to prosperity and progress, thus achieving (increased production), and this is
                            what we lack in most of our Arab societies, given the political greed and greed that
                            afflicted many officials.<br><br>What I mentioned above are just some of the highlights that
                            we need in our daily life, to think about our goals and the reasons for our pursuit of
                            learning, and always ask ourselves whether we really do this what we need from our learning,
                            have we achieved that, and what is the rate of our achievement of it, if the answer is not
                            satisfactory, then this It means that you teach us in it a defect, and the thing in it is
                            imperfect, so we are enough of a tradition, so let us think about the words of the Almighty
                            (Do not follow what you have no ˹sure˺ knowledge of. Indeed, all will be called to account
                            for ˹their˺ hearing, sight, and intellect.).<br><br>I conclude this article by the
                            Australian scientist William Bragg, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics: “The important thing
                            about knowledge and science is not getting the facts so much as discovering new ways of
                            thinking about them. The illiterate in the future are not those who do not know how to read
                            and write or even computer skills and modern technologies, but they are the ones who do not
                            benefit from learning opportunities.<br><br></p>
