                        <p>On the authority of Othman bin Affan, may God be pleased with him, that the Prophet - may God
                            bless him and grant him peace - said: “The best of you is the one who has learned the Qur’an
                            and taught it.<br><br>How to understand the hadith of your best interests in learning the
                            Qur’an and its knowledge? And the noble hadith indicates that the best words are the words
                            of God Almighty and His verses which He revealed in the Holy Qur’an, and if the best and
                            best words are the words of God, then the best and best of people after the messengers whom
                            God Almighty has chosen are those who learn the words of God Almighty and teach it to
                            people.As for the one who said in the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari: “This is the one who
                            held me to my seat.”<br><br>The one who sat was Abd al-Rahman al-Salami, and what was meant
                            was that when Uthman narrated the hadith in the preference for learning the Book of God
                            Almighty and teaching it, he made that Abd al-Rahman al-Salami sit to teach the Quran to
                            people In order for him to attain this reward and merit. [4] And Al-Manawi said in
                            explaining the hadith: “That is, the best of the educated and the teachers was the one whose
                            learning and teaching were in the Qur’an. The best of speech is the word of God. So the best
                            of people after the prophets is the one who worked with him.” The one who combines learning
                            the Book of God Almighty and teaches it to others, for he is a person who has worked to
                            complete himself and is also complementary to others, for it is a combination between the
                            minor and the transgressive benefit, and this is the reason for his preference.He is one of
                            those whom God Almighty intended by saying in Surat Fussalat: {And whose words are better
                            than someone who calls ˹others˺ to Allah, does good, and says, “I am truly one of those who
                            submit.”?.”<br><br>The Qur’an and its knowledge? The Noble Qur’an is the word of God
                            Almighty with which the Prophet - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - addressed him,
                            and God Almighty made it flexible in it to suit every time and place and be a method for all
                            Muslims to gain from it merit and benefit. And contemplation, and the saying of the Prophet,
                            peace and blessings of God be upon him: “Your best thing is to learn the Qur’an and teach
                            it,” is the best commandment for Muslims and the greatest thing that a servant achieves in
                            his life.<br><br>The councils of learning the Noble Qur’an are the ones that God Almighty
                            loves. It came from the Prophet - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - while it was
                            narrated on the authority of Abu Hurairah that he said: “No people gathered together in a
                            house of God, reciting the Book of God, and studying them, and they taught them. Mercy
                            overcame them, and the angels enveloped them, and God reminded them of those in his
                            presence.<br><br>Benefits of the hadith What Ibn Katheer said after mentioning this hadith
                            is that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “The best of you is to learn the
                            Qur’an and its knowledge.” He mentioned the characteristics of the believing servants of God
                            who follow the messengers. For the Book of God Almighty, and thus they have combined between
                            the benefit that is limited by their own benefit, and the transgressive benefit that is
                            beneficial to others, unlike the disbelievers.<br><br>Likewise, it is the concern of
                            believers that people choose to complete themselves and strive to complete others. [7] Tips
                            and methods for being one who has learned the Qur’an and teaches it How can a Muslim join
                            the ranks of the Holy Qur’an? Being keen on learning the Book of God Almighty and teaching
                            it is necessary to urge Islam to it, and to make charitable and preference for those who
                            learn the Book of God Almighty and teach it to others, and there are many tips and ways to
                            learn and teach the Noble Qur’an, including: Learn the Noble Qur’an What are the best
                            methods for learning the Noble Qur’an? There are many ways to learn the Noble Qur’an,
                            including: For a Muslim to learn it at the hands of a sheikh who has mastered the Book of
                            God To use the means that help and aid in learning the Book of God, such as television
                            programs; There are many satellite channels that display a recitation of the Holy Qur’an
                            throughout the day, and there are also programs that help teach the rulings of tajweed and
                            other sciences of the Holy Qur’an.<br><br>The Muslim is to act according to what is stated
                            in the Qur’an by applying the commands of God Almighty and avoiding what he forbade,
                            believing all the news that are mentioned in it, and coming up with the rulings that God
                            Almighty has imposed on the most complete way.<br><br>Verbal recitation: It is reciting the
                            Noble Qur’an in a recitation. Many hadiths have been mentioned that show the merit of
                            someone who reads the Qur’an, including what the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be
                            upon him, said: “Whoever reads a letter from the Book of God has a good deed in it, and a
                            good deed is ten times greater, I do not say pain is a letter, but a thousand A letter and a
                            meme is a letter.<br><br>”[12] [11] Teaching the Noble Qur’an What methods should be used in
                            teaching the Noble Qur’an to others? The methods of teaching the Qur’an are many, including:
                            [13] Diversity in methods of teaching it, once indoctrinating and another, listening while
                            teaching them the rulings of intonation, and trying to think about the verses while teaching
                            them with the learner.<br><br>The use of modern education methods by phone, for example, or
                            modern social means that help in this. Diversifying the forms of reading, once reading is
                            collective and one-on-one, or reading once in secret and once aloud according to ages and
                            groups, and focusing on the method of indoctrination in teaching the Noble Qur’an, which is
                            one of the most effective methods of teaching the Book of God. Linking the verses that are
                            taught to the concepts of life in their general form, and this greatly contributes to the
                            understanding of the verse for the learner.<br><br>Divide the learners into groups and try
                            to conduct some activities and competitions that would help in memorizing and teaching the
                            Holy Quran. Use the element of suspense and excitement before starting to study the Holy
                            Quran, and random introductions are not followed at the same moment.<br><br></p>
