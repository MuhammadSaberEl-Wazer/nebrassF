We can divide the sciences into two major sections that include all the science we know or need, and these two sections are: Sharia sciences and life sciences.<br><br>Sharia sciences and life sciences As for Sharia sciences, they are the sciences with which God Almighty is known, and by which He is known as how true worship is, and this includes all sciences related to the study of religion and Sharia jurisprudence, such as the sciences of the Qur’an, the sciences of the Sunnah and the noble hadith, the sciences of the faith, the sciences of jurisprudence and its origins, and the sciences of ethics And other things related to Sharia and religion.<br><br>Related to this section are some other sciences that are needed in the jurisprudence of those forensic sciences, such as the sciences of language, literature, history, and so on. As for the life sciences, they are the useful sciences that a person needs in order to fix his life, construct his land with it, and explore with it his being and his environment, such as the sciences of medicine , engineering , astronomy , chemistry , physics , geography , earth, plant and animal sciences, and other similar sciences. The word “knowledge,” which was frequently referred to in the Qur’an and Sunnah, means - in most cases - knowledge in its legal and life parts, and all that came as praise for the scholars, it is for every scientist who benefits people with his knowledge, whether it is legal or life.<br><br>The sciences of fard al-'iyn and the sciences of imposition of adequacy, and then these sciences - whether the sciences of Sharia or the sciences of life - are in turn divided into two parts: the sciences of fard al-'iyn and the sciences of fard kifaya.<br><br>And the imposition of the eye is what the street has asked to do with a firm request from each particular obligator, so it is not sufficient for some to do it without others, including prayer, fasting, fulfillment of contracts, and so on.<br><br>And the imposition of sufficiency is what the street has demanded a firm request from the group of those responsible, and if one of them or some of them raises it in the required manner, the sin is waived for the rest, and if no one does it, everyone has sinned, and among them: jihad for the sake of God, establishing the caliphate, praying for the dead and burying him, and others .<br><br>Based on that, the sciences that are considered among the duties of the eye are those that every Muslim man and woman who is characterized by reason and adulthood should attain and learn, and if he does not get it, he has sinned because of that, and the bad consequences of this are the size of the negligence that he neglected.<br><br>This type of science is inevitable for all Muslims, and there is no exception to it, and it is what the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, meant in the authentic hadith on the authority of Anas bin Malik, may God be pleased with him, in which he said: “Seeking knowledge is an imperative for every Muslim.<br><br>" As for the sciences, the obligation of sufficiency, they are those sciences that if some Muslims did them perfectly and were able to stop the rest of the ummah in it, then they would be rewarded for it and sin is waived for the rest of the ummah, even those who did not do it, and if the ummah did not provide enough scholars for its need In a particular branch, the sin falls on everyone until the ummah suffices its need in that branch, and provides the quantity and quality necessary to fill all the gaps.<br><br>And the duties of sufficiency are very many, and the attentive and conscious nation is the one that distributes the duties of sufficiency among its members in such a way that it fills all the gaps it has, and all its needs are sufficient, so that there is no - for example - a congestion in one area, and a shortage and shortcomings in other areas, and this needs a broad horizon and a comprehensive view .<br><br>Let us try to project these definitions to reality.<br><br>Forensic science The legal sciences, including what is an individual obligation, "must" be learned by every Muslim and he is sinning by neglecting it, and that is the same as knowledge of God Almighty as a general matter, such as knowing that the Almighty is All-Knowing, Experienced, and Capable of everything, and that He is Creator, Merciful, Merciful, Generous and so on.<br><br>Likewise, knowledge of matters of jurisprudence necessary to perform acts of worship, so that the Muslim learns how to perform ablution and how to pray, what are the things that invalidate ablution, what are the nullifiers of prayer, and what is the difference between an obligatory and superfluous prayer, and between what prayer is valid without it, and what prayer is not valid without it, and to know fasting and its rulings, Zakat and its provisions, and to know the things that are permissible and forbidden, especially the well-known ones, which scholars have called “what is known from the religion necessarily” such as the prohibition of adultery, wine, pork and usury, and he must also know his noble Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, and a summary of his biography, and also know the Qur’an and how it is recited, It is known about the Hour and the Day of Resurrection in general, as well as about Heaven and Hell, and so on.<br><br>Among the Sharia sciences is what is a sufficient obligation on some scholars of the nation and is not imposed on the rest of the Muslims, such as the minutes of the science of belief, the minutes of jurisprudence such as the jurisprudence of inheritance, the minutes of the jurisprudence of trade for non-traders, how to calculate Zakat in various possibilities, the minutes of economics for non-economists, and the minutes of interpretation of the Qur’an. The reasons for the revelation, the details of the life of the Messenger and the life of his companions, the production of hadiths, knowledge of their narratives, their degrees in terms of wounding and modification, the details of Islamic history, the art of language and its subtleties .<br><br>These sciences are obtained from acquiring knowledge of all its extremities and its subtleties, which is what it is and is wonderful: {˹However,˺ it is not necessary for the believers to march forth all at once. Only a party from each group should march forth, leaving the rest to gain religious knowledge then enlighten their people when they return to them, so that they ˹too˺ may beware ˹of evil˺.}<br><br>At-Tawbah: 122]. And if the ummah does not provide these scholars, and it suffers, for example - a shortage of scholars of interpretation, scholars of jurisprudence, hadith or others, then the entire ummah is sinning until this sect becomes available.<br><br>Life Sciences And the matter is the same with regard to life sciences, some of which are fard ayn, every Muslim and Muslim should learn it and are sinning by not doing it, and some of it is a communal obligation, if some do it it is forfeited to everyone.<br><br>For example: medical science is the imposition of an eye on the physician, engineering science is the imposition of an eye on the engineer, and chemistry is the imposition of an eye on the chemist, and so on. If each one of these learns his profession, mastered it and excels in it, and reaches a degree of innovation and problem-solving in his field, and so on in every specialty, then the imposition is sufficient, and thus sin is waived for Muslims.<br><br>But if the ummah fails to produce a suitable number, and with outstanding efficiency, the Muslims' need is sufficient, then the sin falls on the entire ummah. And that is because it failed to achieve that [4] !! After that, it is not surprising that as a result of this failure the ummah lags behind civilization, that its crises and problems increase, in addition to its fall in the eyes of other nations, and it becomes led by others, and it has become an easy prey for the greedy, so it is not excluded that its sovereignty is violated, and that It occupies its land and robbed its wealth ... until it is lost under the feet of the invaders !! The evidence from that is that a Muslim is caught between two types of sciences that he must master: The first is specific to knowing his religion, the knowledge that leads him to the correct worship, as we mentioned earlier, which is what everyone has to do. And the second is specific to the field of specialization in which he is, whatever his field and nature of work. The guilt and sin in each of them is as large as the default that occurs.<br><br>From this point of view, the one who seeks elevation for this nation, and who hopes to empower it on earth, is not upright, to be a failure in his field, lagging behind in his workmanship, in his profession, or in the knowledge that he was entrusted with. As the progress of the nation depends on its progress, and its backwardness is the result of its backwardness.<br><br>An illustrative example of a Muslim scholar Based on that, if we take a Muslim as an illustrative example, then we say: If there is a specialized Muslim economist, then he must learn how to pray, how to fast, how to pay zakat, how to believe in his Lord, in his Messenger and in the Qur’an, and to know about the Day of Resurrection, Heaven and Hell, as we have already mentioned. Moreover, he must master the field of economics and excel in it, and innovate modern methods that raise the nation’s economy and raise its position financially, and he must also know the Islamic jurisprudence on economics, the rule of Islam in various economic transactions, and his ruling on banking, investment, insurance, savings and loans issues, And other matters that affect this aspect directly.<br><br>But this economist does not have and is not obliged to learn the subtleties of interpretation, or learn the various articles of jurisprudence on medicine, or on war, or pertaining to marriage, divorce, or inheritance. This has specialists and interested people, just as it is in his specialization in the field of economics. He also does not have to learn anything about medicine, engineering, astronomy, agriculture, etc., except in relation to his work as an economist.<br><br>Thus, the nation's competencies are distributed among the various branches, and gaps are filled, respectively.<br><br>The successful nation It is not correct for a successful nation to accumulate in it - for example - jurisprudential energies, while it lacks medical or chemistry scientists, and it is not appropriate for an integrated nation to accumulate a large number of judges, which lacks historical scholars, and so on.<br><br>This is the role of the successful state, to constantly watch for deficiencies, and then fill the defects and be keen on completing them .. It is also the role of individuals to seek to fill important and weak gaps, and not to leave those who specialize in their specialization and become preoccupied with other works that they were not originally assigned to perform. They had to.<br><br>However, the greater role and the huge responsibility in this matter is borne by the state represented in the government, and it must strive to elevate its people and the pride of its nation in all areas, and it is not excused for any negligence in this matter, and there is no justification for staying at the tail of nations for years and years. This does not mean - as we have already indicated - exempting ourselves from responsibility, for this is the fate of the nation, and we - as individuals - have huge spaces in which we can work and produce and excel a lot and much.<br><br>For example, a student in any educational stage can not be satisfied with what is prescribed to him only, especially if this course is at an insufficient level, and then he can resort to libraries and the global network (the Internet) and others, which increases his academic achievement in his academic courses. And in his field of specialization.<br><br>If he is a student, he is a superior student, if he is a professor or a teacher, he is a proficient and creative teacher, and if he is an engineer, he is of the highest degree and is able to know his field of work and engineering, and so on. And when the commitment to that is, and when it is not the amount of everyone’s knowledge and the maximum of their aspirations is only obtaining a certificate in such or such, then a general atmosphere of love of knowledge prevails, and the country or region has taken the point of knowledge as a kiss to him, whether he willed that or he refused the decision-makers And its makers !! Rather, politicians at that time will find that they have to go along with that scientific wave and be on its ride, just as they are coping with the religious wave - although many of them do not have religious tendencies in the first place - so you see them - for example - hold religious competitions, attend seasonal celebrations, and give prizes for preserving The Holy Quran .. And that as long as there is a general atmosphere of interest in religion.<br><br>Likewise, if there is a scientific revolution, and science has become the concern of individuals and the focus of their interests, then you will find - for example - the politician who wants to succeed in the elections, you see him putting in his election program interest in scientific institutions, working on establishing new ones and more, and increasing the state budget in this aspect. Accordingly, you will not find his interests directed only to food and drink, etc., but rather the bulk of his interests will be the nation's primary concern and preoccupation, which on that day is knowledge and issues of education !! And if the Islamic Ummah had played its role in this field (concern for the balance between sciences and the link between legal science and life science), government and people, groups and individuals, it would never have lacked anything else, and would have stood dependent on the arms of its children, and this - I doubt - raises its value and cherishes its status.<br><br></p></div></div><div class="paragraphbtn"><a href="./index.html">Know More</a></div></div></div></section><section class="know" id="know "><div class="container"><div
